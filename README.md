# CSharpRuleSet
Custom code analyser ruleset used in Brainjuicer code. When package is installed into a project it also installs [StyleCop.Analyzers](https://github.com/DotNetAnalyzers/StyleCopAnalyzers) and a custom ruleset which the project is configures to use.

The custom ruleset is essentially Microsoft's Recommended Rules but with fewer requirements on copyright notices and XML documentation
